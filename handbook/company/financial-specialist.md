#  🔦 Financial Specialist

## Let's start with why we exist. 📡

Ever wondered if your employer is monitoring your work computer?

Organizations make huge investments every year to keep their laptops and servers online, secure, compliant, and usable from anywhere. This is called "device management".

At Fleet, we think it's time device management became [transparent](https://fleetdm.com/transparency) and [open source](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#open-source).

## Why should you join us? 🛸

The Business Operations team at Fleet is a growing team of high achieving, collaborative, and enthusiastic spreadsheet nerds.
We've been getting by with our contracted financial services and spreading the regular financial functions across teammates, but as we scale we need someone that can take ownership of all the finacial functions and build our processes to be consistent and scalable.
The team is looking forward to future startup funding rounds, and we want to add a teammate that can help guide and shape our financial operations and reports to support our growth.
Ideal candidate is a player-coach who can grow into finacial leadership as we scale.
